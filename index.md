## About Me 👋

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California Los Angeles. I earned my BSA in Neuroscience with an Evidence and Inquiry certificate from the University of Texas at Austin.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in social connection, information sharing, and loneliness. I am especially passionate about using new statistical and computational methods to investigate these interests 🤖, open science 🥼, and sharing knowledge 👩🏼‍🏫.
