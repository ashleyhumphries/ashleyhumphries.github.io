## Hi 👋! I'm Ashley! 

I am a lab manager at Dr. Maital Neta's [Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab](https://psychology.unl.edu/can-lab/) at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. I earned my BSA in Neuroscience with an Evidence and Inquiry certificate from the University of Texas at Austin.

My research interests lie in social connection, emotion perception and regulation. I am especially passionate about using new statistical and computational methods to investigate these interests 🤖, open science 🥼, and sharing knowledge 👩🏼‍🏫.

You can find more information about my [research](research.md), or my [CV](http://ashleyhumphries.github.io/files/Humphries_CV_2024.pdf) on this website.
